# Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Hardhat framework. It comes with a ERC721 smart contract, a test for that contract, a script that deploys that contract, and 2 examples of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts and lists what the private/API keys are.

Some of the basic commands include:

```shell
`npx hardhat accounts`: to retrieve all framework accounts
`npx hardhat compile`: to compile the smart contract
`npx hardhat test`: to run cases
`npx hardhat run --network rinkeby script/deploy.js`: to deploy a contract to Rinkeby network
`npx hardhat keys`: to lists down private keys
```
